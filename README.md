Andromeda Bootcamp Finishers NFT
This is a Next.js project, built on the Andromeda Protocol, designed to create a decentralized application for claiming "Proof of Participation" NFTs for bootcamp finishers.

Overview
The Andromeda Bootcamp Finishers dApp provides a simple and effective way for event organizers to reward participants with a unique, on-chain collectible. By leveraging the power of Andromeda's low-code ADO framework, we offer a transparent, secure, and engaging platform for distributing digital memorabilia and fostering a sense of community accomplishment.

Visual Tour
Main dApp Interface
Our clean and intuitive user interface welcomes users with a clear call to action. The main page showcases the available NFT collections, allowing participants to easily connect their wallet and claim their "Finisher" NFT.

Features
Proof of Participation NFTs: Each finisher receives a unique, verifiable NFT on the blockchain, serving as a permanent digital trophy.

Decentralized Claiming: Participants can claim their NFT in a peer-to-peer fashion directly from the smart contract.

Low-Code Deployment: Built with Andromeda Digital Objects (ADOs), demonstrating the power and speed of the Andromeda ecosystem for rapid dApp development.

Secure & Transparent: All claims are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring security and transparency for both the organizer and the participant.

Responsive Design: Fully optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring a seamless experience across all platforms.

Use Cases
1. Bootcamp Rewards
Concept: The primary use case is for organizers of technical events like workshops and bootcamps to issue a digital certificate of completion.

NFT Implementation: A single, standard "Finisher" NFT is created for an event. The marketplace is configured to allow any participant to claim one copy for free (paying only the network gas fee).

Andromeda Protocol Integration: Utilizes Andromeda's CW721 (NFT) and Marketplace ADOs for NFT creation and distribution logic.

2. Community Building & Engagement
Concept: The claimed NFT serves as a badge of honor within the community, identifying skilled members and encouraging future participation.

Examples:

Discord Role Gating: Use the NFT to grant holders a special "Finisher" or "Alumni" role in a Discord server.

Access to Exclusive Content: Future workshops or advanced materials could be restricted to holders of a previous event's NFT.

Andromeda Protocol Integration: The on-chain nature of the NFT makes it easy for other applications to verify ownership and grant perks.

3. Verifiable Digital Credentials
Concept: Beyond a simple collectible, the NFT acts as a verifiable credential that a participant can showcase on their professional profile or resume.

Examples:

A developer can prove they completed a specific Andromeda Protocol bootcamp.

A designer can show they won a UI/UX award at a bootcamp's final project competition.

Andromeda Protocol Integration: The immutability of the blockchain ensures the credential cannot be faked or altered.

Technical Architecture
The Andromeda Bootcamp Finishers dApp is built with a modern tech stack:

Frontend
Next.js: React framework providing server-side rendering and static site generation.

TypeScript: For type-safe code development.

Chakra UI: Component library for accessible and responsive design.

React Query: Data fetching and state management.

Backend
Andromeda Protocol: Blockchain infrastructure for all NFT operations.

Cosmos SDK: The underlying blockchain framework.

AndromedaJS: JavaScript/TypeScript SDK for interfacing with Andromeda Protocol.

Deployment
Vercel: Hosting platform optimized for Next.js applications.

GitHub Actions: CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
